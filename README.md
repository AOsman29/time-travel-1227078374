# Time Travel Zine
I am learning Git by creating a mini magazine about time machines and timelines.
## .gitignore Explanation
The .gitignore file keeps compiled `.class` files and the `target/` folder (from Maven builds) out of version control so the repo stays clean and portable.
## Branch Usage
- **author/idea-sprint:** Used for drafting and brainstorming zine ideas.
- **editor/review:** Used for reviewing and editing finalized content before merging to main.
